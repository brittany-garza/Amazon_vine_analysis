# Amazon_vine_analysis

Overview of the analysis: 
The purpose of this analysis is to get insight of pet product reviews left by Amazon customers. 

Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions:

How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
170 reviews were Vine reviews and 37840 were non-Vine reviews. 

How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
65 reviews were Vine and 5-star reviews. 20612 were non-Vine reviews but were 5-star reviews. 

What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

The percentage for vine five-star reviews is 0.17%. The percentage for non-vine five-star reviews is 52.35%

Summary:
I think there is a positive bias of the vine five-star reviews. Even though about 50% of the reviews are non-vine subscribers, we can still review the non-vine reviews 
for feedback. One additional analysis that will be helpful is reviewing the 3- and 4-star reviews. Vine and non-vine customers could provide new ideas or improvements for 
future products.
